  <h2>the idea</h2>
  <p>I've been in the pickle a lot lately where I have a link on one computer or my phone, and I want to save it so I can look at it at home on my own computer. I don't want to go through the hassle of opening up my email and emailing it to myself, or posting it on my facebook so "only me" can see it. I want them all amalgamated somewhere I can go to and take a look. </p>

  <p>I've also been in the predicament where I will have some tabs open for something to read later when I come to the topic, but don't want to keep them open because I'm running out of tab room. What can I do with it? Copy the link somewhere so I can access it later. Except I haven't signed up for something like Pocket because I don't want it on a reading list, I just want to look at it later.</p>

  <p>I like to think that everyone has been in this situation before, and this is my solution.</p>


  <h2>the implementation</h2>
  <p>The idea is simple. All you do is paste your link, give it a title for context and press save and it's in your list! Easy peasy. Since it's only one page, there's no chance of getting lost or losing links. All your links for later or in a couple days are listed, easily accessible and in a list sorted by when you added them.</p>

  <p>The design is also minimalistic so that nothing gets in the way, you don't need anything flashy to list some links, on a page you're just using for going to other pages anyway. Why make it complicated?</p>
